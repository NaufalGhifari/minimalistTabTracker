# minimalistTabTracker
A small node project to keep track of tabs i.e. who owes whom and how much. This project aims to:
1. Showcase a minimal full-stack capability: front-end, back-end, and database.
2. Showcase CRUD database operations from a web application.

💡 To get the app running:
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Open a terminal in the cloned repo
- type 'npm init', this will install all dependncies
- Once done, type 'npm start' this runs the application
- Either click on the link on the terminal or go to 'http://localhost:4000'
- You are now using minmalistTabTracker!

⚒️ Node package dependencies:
- express.js
- ejs
- nodemon

💽 Database: SQLite
With SQLite, it is possible to setup a portable (serverless) relational database. This makes it easier to showcase the project as no setup/connection required. While still allowing the ability to show how the database is setup and how queries are handled. 
- SQLite database location: src/db/mySQLiteDB.db
- To see database setup, see src/db/db_init.js
