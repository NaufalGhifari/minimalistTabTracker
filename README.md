# minimalistTabTracker
A small node project to keep track of tabs i.e. who owes whom and how much.  
**This project aims to:**
1. Showcase a minimal full-stack capability: front-end, back-end, and database.
2. Showcase CRUD database operations from a web application.

## üí° To get the app running:
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
2. Open a terminal in the cloned repo
3. type 'npm init', this will install all dependncies
4. Once done, type 'npm start'. This runs the application
5. Either click on the link in the terminal OR go to 'http://localhost:4000' on your browser
6. You are now using minmalistTabTracker!

## ‚öíÔ∏è Node package dependencies:
- express.js
- ejs
- nodemon
- sqlite3

## üíΩ Database: SQLite 
With [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), it is possible to setup a portable (serverless) relational database. This makes it easier to showcase the project as no setup/connection required. While still allowing the ability to show how the database is setup and how queries are handled. 
- SQLite database location: src/db/mySQLiteDB.db
- To see database setup, see [src/db/db_init.js](src/db/db_init.js)
